What is Git
------------------------------------------

Git is a version control system that is widely used for software development. It is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
Git was initially designed and developed in 2005 by Linux kernel developers (including Linus Torvalds) for Linux kernel development.




------------------------------------------
What is the difference between Git and Github
------------------------------------------

Git is the system, Github is the interface to that system. The Git is like engine in a car and Github is the dashboard.
Apart from Github, you can also control Git using command line or Github Desktop software (https://desktop.github.com/):
    1. command line is most advanced tool to control git, but is going to to display one thing at a time (status, current branch, etc)
    2. github desktop (purple cat software) can only complete basic tasks (commit, push pull, etc) but is going to display full info about your repository
    3. github.com is website specialised in the collaborative (multiple user collaborate in the same code) part of the git

------------------------------------------
How to use Git
------------------------------------------

There are 3 ways we use github:

    1. To create backups (this is the most often usage for it at Thinkful):
        --> We only do that when we know that the code has no bugs or conflicts and a part of the website is complete (for example "header ready").
    2. To test new code:
        --> We create a new branch from the master and we call that branch the name of we want to build (lets say footer); we continue working on that branch until the footer is ready; after that we take all the code from the master, we make sure that there are no conflicts or errors, and than we push the code back to master (including the new functionality).
    3. When multiple developers are working on the same code:
        --> Each developer creates a new branch with the name of they want to build (letâ€™s say one is building the login and the other the shopping chart); they keep working in their own branches until they complete the tasks; after that they take all the code from the master, we make sure that there are no conflicts or errors, and than they push the code back to master (including the new functionality).

How the Git works
------------------------------------------

There are 2 main cycles:

    1. Create-a-New-Project Cycle (create the repository ON the Github.com SERVER and then clone it locally)
        a) Go to github.com and create a new repository
        b) Clone that repository from github.com on own computer using the command line or the Github Desktop UI Software




    2. Daily-Back-Up-Your-Project Cycle (commit changes and synchronize)
        Note: Run the following command inside the repository folder

        //prepack the code
        a) git add . ;
        --> means add all the files in that particular folder to be pre-packed for the commit
        b) git commit -m 'Some message for you future self explaining why is this commit important';
        --> means commit is happening only on the local machine (no communication with the server possible); -m stand for a message (it is a message to self about the content of that commit; example: changing the header color)

        //send it to the server
        c) git pull origin master;
        --> means download all the code from the server and make sure there are no conflict with your own code
        d) git push --set-upstream origin master;
        --> means synchronise your own code with the server

        All commands on one line shortcut:
        git add . ; git commit -m 'REPLACE-ME'; git pull origin master; git push --set-upstream origin master      <---




When to commit code to the server?
    -> when a particular part of the code is completed (let's say the footer is ready) BUT make sure there are no bugs or conflicts
    -> at the end of the day (but only if the code is fully functional and has no bugs)




Jargon Buster
    -> fork = on the Github.com server, copy repository from one user account to another (this is done without any connection to your local computer)
    -> clone = copy repository from your own account on the server to your own computer (only if you don't have project on your own computer)
    -> pull = copy the existing code from the your repository in your online Github.com account to update the folder on your own computer
    -> push = the code on your own computer to your repository in your online Github.com account to update




Master and branches

    --> Master (in production environment this is the live website)
    --> branch_1 (some branch to test something)
    --> gh-pages (in Github this is the live website)




How to merge the Master into GH-Pages

    git checkout gh-pages
    git merge master
    git push origin gh-pages
