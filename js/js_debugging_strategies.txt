/* Debugging strategies

Example: trying to fix the remote for a TV

debugging level 1 => check if JS syntax is correct (check console in Web Dev)
--> a real life example: make sure that your TV remote has batteries
debugging level 2 => check if the targeting is working (check the connection between the HTML element and equivalent JS functionality ==> alert("here"); inside the function)
--> a real life example: make sure that your remote connects to your own TV
debugging level 3 => check if the logic makes sense (check if the JS functionality returns what we expect ==> alert(VALUE-NAME); inside the function)
--> a real life example: make sure that when you click on the volume up button on your remote, you don't get to change channels or similar
*/

Check the logic inside the functions and objects (variable definitions, ifs, loops, etc. )

Check the variable, object flow between the functions

Check the final output
